# neo4j-knowledge-graph

## Overview
The `neo4j-knowledge-graph` project is designed to leverage the power of Neo4j, a leading graph database, to create and manage knowledge graphs. This project aims to facilitate the organization, visualization, and querying of complex relationships within data, making it easier to derive insights and make informed decisions.

## Features
- **Graph Data Modeling**: Define and manage complex relationships between entities.
- **Cypher Query Language**: Utilize Neo4j's powerful query language to extract meaningful information from your data.
- **Visualization Tools**: Integrate with visualization libraries to represent data graphically.
- **Scalability**: Handle large datasets efficiently with Neo4j's robust architecture.
